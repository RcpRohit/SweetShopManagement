# Sweet Shop Management System

## Project Overview
The **Sweet Shop Management System** is a modern web application designed to manage a sweet shop's operations efficiently. It allows users to register, log in, browse sweets, and make purchases. Admins can manage sweets inventory and track sales.

**Technologies Used:**
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java), Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- Database: MySQL
- Dev Tools: Maven, Git, Postman
- AI Assistance: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/register	Register a new user
POST	/api/auth/login	Login user and get JWT token
GET	/api/sweets	Fetch all sweets
POST	/api/sweets	Add a new sweet (Admin only)

DELETE	/api/sweets/:id	Delete sweet (Admin only)
POST	/api/purchase	Purchase sweet (User)

My AI Usage
During the development of this project, I used AI tools to enhance productivity, brainstorm ideas, and generate code snippets.

Tools Used
ChatGPT: Assisted in writing React components, generating backend service logic, and debugging errors.

GitHub Copilot: Suggested code completions, generated unit tests, and helped scaffold functions for API integration.

How AI Was Used
Frontend Development:

Used ChatGPT to generate the Login and Register components with proper error handling and loading states.

Copilot helped autocomplete repetitive JSX code, form validations, and Tailwind CSS classes.

Backend Development:

ChatGPT suggested Spring Boot controller and service methods for managing sweets and purchases.

Copilot generated repository methods and DTO mappings.

Debugging & Optimization:

ChatGPT helped identify and solve Babel parsing errors in the frontend.

Suggested TypeScript typings and proper API response handling.

Reflection on AI Impact
AI significantly improved my workflow by:

Reducing repetitive coding tasks.

Offering multiple ways to structure code and handle edge cases.

Helping quickly troubleshoot errors, saving hours of debugging.

Boosting confidence in implementing TypeScript + React + Spring Boot integration.
Overall, AI acted as a virtual pair programmer, enhancing productivity and code quality.

I can also create a **ready-to-use version with your AI usage reflecting **exact ChatGPT prompts and Copilot suggestions you actually used**, to make it more personalized and professional.  

Do you want me to do that?
